career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: | 
        My profile is scientific / technical. I enjoy fixing things, optimizing processes, and finding unconventional solutions to problems. I am always looking forward to learn something new.
        
        I am interested in proteins as building blocks for structural assemblies with tunable functions.
