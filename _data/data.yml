        During my PhD, I worked in the mechanisms of biogenesis of Cytochrome c Oxidase from Arabidopsis thaliana, particularly, the assembly of a copper site (CuA).  With this aim I first designed and engineered a chimeric protein (Tt3LAt), which mimics the CoxII subunit of A. thaliana, being stable in solution. I achieve this by engineering the functional part of A. thaliana CoxII into the thermostable scaffold from Thermus thermophilus’ homolog protein. I characterized spectroscopically and functionally this protein in its apo and copper-bound forms. I performed and analyzed the electronic absorption and EPR spectra of the oxidized CuA protein and characterized the site. I also assigned and analyzed the paramagnetically shifted NMR signals from the coordinating residues. Working in collaboration we also solved the copper-bound crystal structure of the proteins (PDB 6PTT). The analysis of all this data revealed novel features about the electron transfer pathways in CuA proteins (Morgada et al., ChemComm, 2020). 
 Afterward, I expressed and purified a putative assembly factor of A. thaliana Cox II (Hcc1). I showed that It is a copper-binding protein, being able to bind both Cu(I) and Cu(II) with high affinity. I characterized spectroscopically (by UV-Vis, CD, NMR, EPR) the Cu(II) binding site and, in collaboration, we solved the structure of the Cu(I)-bound form (PDB 6N5U). Finally, I assessed the functional features of this protein by in vitro NMR experiments. I showed that it is a copper metallochaperone, inserting two copper ions into the CuA site from Tt3LAt (Llases et al., FEBS J. 2019).
